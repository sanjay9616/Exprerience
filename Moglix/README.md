# Moglix Experience


I have played a key role in several high-impact projects at Moglix, utilizing my expertise in Angular, Angular Material, RxJS, and NgRx to build scalable, high-performance web applications. With hands-on experience in ReactJS and NextJS, I have successfully crafted dynamic, user-friendly interfaces. My solid background in JavaScript, TypeScript, and data structures has allowed me to tackle complex problems with efficient solutions.

I’m highly skilled in working with RESTful Web Services and integrating RESTful APIs to ensure smooth communication between front-end and back-end systems. Throughout my work, I’ve leveraged cutting-edge technologies and tools, such as Observables and RxJS, Angular Reactive Forms, Bootstrap, Angular CLI, Dependency Injection, Lazy Loading, Routing, Directives, Pipes, VS Code, GitHub, and Linux.

By maintaining a focus on clean code and version control, I’ve consistently contributed to streamlined project delivery and enhanced user experiences. My passion for innovation and attention to detail have been instrumental in driving successful outcomes in every project I’ve been a part of.
