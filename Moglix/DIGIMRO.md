- Streamlined Support Processes:
    - Centralizing contact information based on brand selection helps streamline support processes. Support teams can better prepare for inquiries by anticipating the types of issues or questions that may arise based on the brand selected.
- Brand-Specific Knowledge:
    - The update allows support staff to focus on brand-specific knowledge and expertise, improving the quality of assistance provided to customers. This can lead to faster resolution times and better overall support experiences.
- Operational Efficiency:
    - By categorizing support requests by brand, the support team can more effectively allocate resources and manage workloads, leading to improved efficiency and response times.
- Reduced Response Time:
    - With clear contact details and streamlined communication channels, customers can expect faster responses to their inquiries, which can lead to increased trust and confidence in the brand.
