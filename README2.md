## Task 1: EOC-2802 Pick Supplier Credit Term from Exception List in RFQ & CPO Item Sheet

**Current Behavior:** When a supplier is mapped in the RFQ or CPO Item Sheet, the supplier credit term is fetched via API from SC.

**Going Forward:** SCM will maintain a separate exception list for supplier ID-plant ID combinations. When a supplier ID is selected on EOC, the system will check the exception list for a credit term and pre-fill it in EOC; otherwise, the default supplier credit term will be used.

**Impact:** Automates credit term selection, improving accuracy and reducing manual input in the RFQ and CPO process.
